# Grid-Search-iterator-for-ANN
To find the most optimum architecture for an ANN (regression) by iterating through each hyperparameter. The results are stored in an excel sheet.

This particular code iterates for a range of neurons in three hidden layers, each layer's actiivation function and optimizer.
